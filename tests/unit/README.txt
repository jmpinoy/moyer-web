Tests written and executed in Selenium Browser Extension for Chrome or Firefox, you will need this to run tests.

Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd?hl=en
Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide/

Open MoyerTests.side file in Selenium

To run a Suite, select a test from the suite and click Run All Tests

Notes:
Reduce test speed to prevent false failures by the browser not loading fast enough
When a page expands vertically instead of horizontally, maximize the page to prevent header being inaccessable
Filter Component has to be tested manually as Selenium doesnt like the drop down menus (or I was doing it wrong, a strong possibility)
