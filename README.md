# Introduction 
Moyer Cabinets is looking to rebrand their website and logo updating the style to a 21st century look and giving their clients a better way to view their product. Currently they are hosting their website on Wix.com and purchased their domain through GoDaddy. They are wanting to get away from Wix and want to build a more customizable website instead of the standard “cookie-cutter” website offered by Wix. The new system will offer a more modern view and give their customers a better visualization of the products offered by Moyer Cabinets by allowing them to search via filters (ex: a modern, traditional, or standard type of cabinets).
